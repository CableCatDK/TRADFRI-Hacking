## Introduction
This document describes my findings of the IKEA TRÃ…DFRI firmware downloaded
from the GU10 light bulb (LED1650R5). According to the binary, it contained
version 1.2.214. As of writing, this was the latest firmware available.

## Dumping firmware
To dump (or flash) firmware of a module, you have to use an external debugger.
I have used a [STK3600](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/mcu/32-bit/efm32lg-starter-kit)
in debugger output mode.

You can use software like [JLink](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/)
or [OpenOCD](http://www.openocd.org) to flash the target.

### J-Link
If you use J-Link, you can use the command below to connect to the ICC-1 or
ICC-A-1 module:

```
JLink -If SWD -Speed 5000 -Device EFR32MG1PXXXF256
```

To dump the flash contents, use the command below (0x40000 is 256 KiB):

```
savebin output.bin 0x0 0x40000
```

To load a flash from file, use the following command:

```
loadbin output.bin 0x0
verifybin output.bin 0x0
```

I have confirmed that you can dump the flash, erase the device and load it
again, and the light bulb will still work.

## Flash layout
Inside the [strings](firmwares/ikea/led1650r5-1.2.214.strings), references are
made to certain C sources named `bootloader-interface-app.c`. This seems to
refer to Silicon Labs application note
[AN772](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an772-using-legacy-application-bootloader.pdf).

This application note suggest a flash layout (figure 2.1) that looks like this:

* 0x00000 - 0x03fff -> Bootloader + recovery image (16 KiB)
* 0x04000 - 0x????? -> Application data
* 0x????? - 0x3ffff -> Simulated EEPROM

Looking at a binary map of the firmware (created using
[binvis.io](http://binvis.io)), we can clearly identify three regions, of which
the second region starts at 0x04000 and the third one at 0x3d000.

## SPI NOR Flash contents
The board provides a 2MBit (256KiB) SPI NOR Flash. Using the
[SPI Flash Dump](firmwares/riot-os/spi_flash_dump) utility, I dumped the flash
contents.

It seems seem that the flash chip is not used for this LED bulb. When dumping
its contents, it only reads 0xFF (I have verified this utility against a known
working flash chip before using).
